# AI-Workbench-Test-Scripts
Some easy to use python scripts to know if your Deep learning framework is working as intended.


## Stuff I want in here

### Tensorflow

To-do

 - [X] Basic Tensorflow test (No Training nor inference, Just tensorflow checking for GPU)
 - [ ] Basic Tensorflow test with training and inference

### Pytorch

To-do
 - [ ] Basic Pytorch test (No Training nor inference, Just tensorflow checking for GPU)
 - [ ] Basic Pytorch test with training and inference

### Additional Frameworks/Runtimes (Same tests as above)

 - [ ] Caffe
 - [ ] CNTK
 - [ ] TensorRT (In TF and Pytorch, along with standalone)
 - [ ] Onnx


### Finally

Learn to make a GUI with python, and wrap this for fun :)
